MIT Capstone Fullstack Banking Application
This Project is to showcase skills learned on a fullstack application. Simulating a bank application, the app its self is a react application. The front end utlizes Js with styling from bootstrap and the back end uses a mongo database.
This bank app has all the feature you would find on a typical bank app. That being said, the goal was not only to make a functioning app, but to make it as user friendly as possible. The app starts on the home page which has a introduction. At the Top of the screen is a easy to use navigation bar where you will find tabs to navigate the apps functions as follows.
-Home
-Create Account
-Log in
-Deposit
-Withdraw
-All data
